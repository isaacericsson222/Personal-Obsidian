The violin is a stringed instrument played with a bow to create soft lullabies or intense and fast paced dancing songs.

Violins care very versatile in a musical sense from the wide variety of songs you are able to play as well as being able to move more freely than with something big and bulky like the guitar or the violin's big brother, the cello.
