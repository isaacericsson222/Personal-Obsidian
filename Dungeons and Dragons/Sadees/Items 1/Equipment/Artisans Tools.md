- Insight to determine emotional state of writer
- Knowledge to determine where and from what paper or ink was crafted, age of the document, etc
- Investigation (advantage) to spot alterations or forgeries
- Deception to impersonate someone else's writing

- Rules for Crafting Magic Items: DMG P.128 (errata states single use items cost half listed price)

- TL/DR: Cantrip & 1st level scrolls cost 50gp, 2nd and 3rd cost 250gp, 4th and 5th cost 2500gp to make plus any material component cost. You can do 25gp worth of work per day. Only people with the spell possible to cast/learn on their spell lists can use the scroll.
