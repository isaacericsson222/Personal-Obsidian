If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an [improvised weapon](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Weapons?expansion=34047#h-Improvised%20Weapons) (see "Improvised Weapons" later in the section). A [sling](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:Sling?expansion=34047) must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

**_Range._** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.

**_Two-Handed._** This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
