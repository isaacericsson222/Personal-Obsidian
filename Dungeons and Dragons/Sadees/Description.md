Sadees looks nervous, his eyes dart around even as you try to grab his attention. They seem to be studying you and at the same time trying to find the best way to leave the area. He is not built but has a surprising dexterity and grace that in another life could have done him well in dance. His clothing is usually specific and orderly, the same can't be said for his hair which is an unruly mop on his head. Prolonged conversations with him can reveal that his mannerisms easily begin to mimic those that he is talking too.
