You may approach a target with a melee attack. The target must be _**dead**_. You may make a Charisma roll, (adding whatever your best charisma skill modifier is). This will set the DC for the target to beat. If they beat the DC, the Domination has failed and the target remains dead. If the target **fails** the DC, you may add them to your list of Goldenthorns. (You have a Goldenthorn slot for each character level you have).

- Use once per enemy
- Needs soul (and body?)
