Winged Sentry failed, breached gate but no coordinates, we won and rallied behind the stillbane and ended Typhon Plague. We failed to destroy the Winged Sentry, with the stillbane, the heart of Ellowhyne, we sealed him in the tomb of Zyphera (the continent?)

Only thing any mortal is vulnerable to is time, let the Millenia wear away the Winged Sentries power, then once and for all, the Stillbane can banish Typhus(typo?) from Inarian(our planet)

Stilldream, general of the dreamers (100 winged thingy), 4 armed guys are typhons, Ashazi (Tarkus guys are sand fey) (Oak is dryad?? maybe), Kaitan (demon chained the dragon)
