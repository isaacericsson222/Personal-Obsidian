Your exposure to the Feywild's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

- You learn the [Misty Step](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the [Divination](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:divination) or [Enchantment](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:enchantment) school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
