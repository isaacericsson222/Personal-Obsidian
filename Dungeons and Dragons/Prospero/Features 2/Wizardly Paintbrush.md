At 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can magically create a paintbrush in your free hand. The magic paintbrush has the following properties:

- The paintbrush doesn't require ink. When you write with it, it produces paint in a color of your choice on the writing surface.

- The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the paintbrush for the transcription.

- You can erase anything you write with the paintbrush if you wave the end over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

This paintbrush disappears if you create another one or if you die.
